A comprehensive approach to utilizing TypeScript for static input in React and Redux apps. This tutorial details the most significant patterns and secrets for using TypeScript to leverage React (and its ecosystem) in a functional approach. It will assist you in making your code completely type-safe while focusing on inferring types from implementation.

It performs things in an unusual, attractive, or extraordinary manner. (And it’s not very well-known or popular… there’s no use in including those.)
It has recently committed code!

💡 Why?
React custom hooks allow to abstract components' business logic into single reusable functions.
So far, we've found that most of the hooks we've created and therefore shared between our internal projects have quite often a similar gist that involves callback references, events and components' lifecycle.
For this reason we've tried to sum up that gist into beautiful-react-hooks: a collection of (hopefully) useful React hooks to possibly help other companies and professionals to speed up their development process.

Furthermore, we created a concise yet concrete API having in mind the code readability, focusing to keep the learning curve as lower as…
