You'll find the source code for the apps in the apps/ subdirectory.

Thank you to every developer who has worked on a project this repo links to, your work is helping developers learn React.

How to install on your computer
# Clone this git repo:
git clone git@github.com:jeromedalbert/real-world-react-apps.git

cd real-world-react-apps/

# The apps are linked to as git submodules.
# This will take some time... (see comment below for possible speedup)
git submodule update --init

# OR if you've got git 2.9+ installed try to run updates in parallel:
# git submodule update --init --jobs 4
How you can analyze the apps
Some of the examples below use ag, but could just as well use grep or equivalent.

React & Redux in TypeScript of Complete Guide
‚≠ê Github stars: 12k +

A comprehensive approach to utilizing TypeScript for static input in React and Redux apps. This tutorial details the most significant patterns and secrets for using TypeScript to leverage React (and its ecosystem) in a functional approach. It will assist you in making your code completely type-safe while focusing on inferring types from implementation.

"This guide is a living compendium documenting the most important patterns and recipes on how to use React (and its Ecosystem) in a functional style using TypeScript. It will help you make your code completely type-safe while focusing on inferring the types from implementation so there is less noise coming from excessive type annotations and it's easier to write and maintain correct types in the long run."

üí° Why?
React custom hooks allow to abstract components' business logic into single reusable functions.
So far, we've found that most of the hooks we've created and therefore shared between our internal projects have quite often a similar gist that involves callback references, events and components' lifecycle.
For this reason we've tried to sum up that gist into beautiful-react-hooks: a collection of (hopefully) useful React hooks to possibly help other companies and professionals to speed up their development process.

Furthermore, we created a concise yet concrete API having in mind the code readability, focusing to keep the learning curve as lower as‚Ä¶
