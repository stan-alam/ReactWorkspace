Just as React has transformed the way we build web applications, GraphQL is changing how we build APIs to query and mutate data.

With a focus on modern JavaScript and real world application, this course is a start-to-finish way to learn Full Stack Advanced React, Next.js, GraphQL, Node.js and friends.

Join me as I show you how to build a full stack online store with some of today’s top JavaScript technology.

Together build “Sick Fits”, a full stack online clothing store complete with real credit checkout. Users can search, sell, add to cart and checkout their favourite items.

The application has six main models — Users, Items, Orders, CartItems, OrderItems, and Roles — all of which are relational and showcase the power of relational GraphQL Queries.

The app also includes many server side bits including authentication, permissions, sending email, uploading images, and charging credit cards.

In addition to building both the frontend and backend of the application, Testing the React application.

The Tech Stack of our Application

React.js

For Building The Interface along with:

Next.js for server side rendering, routing and tooling
Styled Components for styling
Context for Managing Local State
Apollo’s React Hooks for interfacing with Apollo Client
Jest & React Testing Library for Testing
Apollo Client

For Data Management

Performing GraphQL Mutations(create, update, delete)
Fetching data via GraphQL Queries
Caching GraphQL Data
Error and Loading UI States
Apollo Client replaces the need for redux + data fetching/caching libraries
Keystone.js

A Node.js based GraphQL Server + Headless CMS For:

Admin Interface to manage data
Provides a set of GraphQL CRUD APIs for a MongoDB or Prisma Database
Schema Definition
Data Relationships
Open Source + Self-hosted
Built with Node.js, React + Next.js
Implementing Query and Mutation Resolvers
Custom Server Side Logic
Charging Credit Cards with Stripe
Sending Email
Performing Authentication
Managing + Checking Roles + Permissions
GraphQL is a type-safe query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

What?! It’s a replacement for (or addition to) your REST API and Ajax Calls.

GraphQL requires buy-in from both your client and your server — it then puts the power of requesting only what you want into the client and the business logic of finding and filtering that data into backend resolvers.

enable libraries that make caching, loading, error handling and pagination a breeze

Complex Relational Data queries and server-side mutations like signing up or checking-out are a snap with GraphQL.

GraphQL is just a standard and can be implemented in any language or framework.

Covered Concepts

learn and implement a concept into our application. Many of the concepts for different parts of the application, hitting and solving new problems each time.
