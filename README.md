# REACT workspace for learning REACT

# Library vs framework

React is not a complete solution for application development. It is often relegated to only a **view-layer** solution.

**React has some mechanisms for maintaining internal state, but it has no opinion about or solutions for data flow and management, server communication, routing or other common frontend application concerns.**

The **Document Object Model** DOM is **SLOW**. If changes to the DOM are relatively infrequent, this may not be a problem for small infrequent calls, in complex applications the time it takes to alter and redraw the DOM **adds up**

To begin creating an interface in React, the first thing we need to do is break down the interface into conceptual components. Start with a large component, and then break into smaller components.

Until there is no longer any reusable functional components.
